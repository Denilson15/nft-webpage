### NFT Webpage

This is a custom-designed NFT landing page built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Inspired by a Scrimba project prompt, I developed the entire layout and styling independently, with a focus on clean structure and responsive design.

> 💡 AI was not used to build this project. It was used solely for documentation purposes such as writing this README. I value building strong programming skills while also knowing how to use AI as a powerful and responsible tool in a modern dev toolkit.

## ✨ Overview

The webpage showcases a modern, mobile-first layout suitable for promoting NFT collections. It includes:

- A hero section highlighting featured NFTs
- A responsive grid layout for displaying items
- Basic interactivity for an engaging user experience

## 🛠️ Personalization

While the original idea came from Scrimba, I customized the entire design:

- Created original HTML structure and CSS layout
- Tweaked color scheme and styling
- Adjusted layout for smaller screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Expand layout for better desktop responsiveness
- Add animations or hover effects
- Explore performance optimizations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – structure of the page
- `style.css` – styling and layout
- `script.js` – interactivity and behavior

## ⚙️ Getting Started
